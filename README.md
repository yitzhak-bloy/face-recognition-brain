## Smartbrain Face Detection App

This app allows the user to detect faces in the image uploaded by them. It makes use of [Clarifai face detection API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection-image-recognition-model-a403429f2ddf4b49b307e318f00e528b-detection). Users can register and upload the image. An entry count is maintained for every user which indicates how many times the user has detected faces.

Front End of the app is created using React. <br/>
NodeJS, ExpressJS is used for server side scripting. <br/>
PostgreSql is used to store user information.

External Libraries like Bcrypt and KnexJS are also used.
